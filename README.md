## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful technique used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. In this notebook, we apply PCA to the components of the DJIA to understand their relationships based on their distances in the PCA loading matrix. This analysis helps in identifying similar and dissimilar components within the index.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vidakpop/Dow-component-based-on-their-distance-in-the-PCA-loading-matrix.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Dow-component-based-on-their-distance-in-the-PCA-loading-matrix
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Dow_components.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.
